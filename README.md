# d3-challenge

Description:
In this challenge, with data from the census bureau, I mapped data on a graph that showed the correlation between median age for each state, and the percentages of smokers in those states.


Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I pulled in data using the d3.csv function, and then built the graph using javascript.  Both the circles and the text (state abbreviation) were bound to the same data.  The tooltips were then added.
